virtual_models.json:
    Needed by the "texture_maps.py" script to correctly detect drawtype.
    Manually created.

nodeboxes.json
    Needed by bridgetest to correctly create models for blocks.
    Contains Node Boxes for every block that is not:
    * Full
    * Air-like (not drawn at all)
    * Flower-like (drawn with two intersecting planes, X-shape)
    * Fire-like
    * Liquid
    Does not contain duplicates, nodeboxes may be used by more than one block.
    Generated by the "texture_maps.py" script.

block_texture_map.json
    Needed by bridgetest to map models and textures to blocks.
    Contains textures for all 6 sides and the draw type for every block.
    The draw type is either one of full/air/fire/flower or a key into "nodeboxes.json".
    Keys into the nodeboxes.json file always start with "NB_".
    Generated by the "texture_maps.py" script.

item_texture_map.json
    Needed by bridgetest to map textures to items. Far simpler version of the block_texture_map.json file.
    Maps exactly one texture to every item.
    Generated by the "texture_maps.py" script.
